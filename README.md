# Drugâ€“Target Interaction Landscape by Gene Essentiality and Disease Ontology

This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of drugâ€“gene interactions by integrating clinical drug data, gene essentiality classifications (FUSIL), and disease ontologies.

# Please RUN the ontology mapping first given that some scripts depends on the output.

## Data Sources

| Source            | Description                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Open Targets** | Drugâ€“targetâ€“indication associations             |
| **DrugBank**      | Curated drugâ€“gene interaction dataset           |
| **FUSIL**         | Functional gene classification by essentiality |
| **EFO Ontology**  | Disease classes and hierarchical mappings      |

## Key Features

- **Comparison of Approved vs Withdrawn Drugs**  
  Evaluate drug distributions by status (e.g. withdrawn, completed)

- **Network-Level Analysis**  
  Degree distributions: drugs per target and targets per drug

- **FUSIL Stratification**  
  Analyze how essentiality bins (CL, DL, SV, VP, VnP) relate to drug targeting

- **Indication-Weighted Targeting Metrics**  
  Calculate indication Ã— drug impact and drugâ€“indication ratios per gene

- **Disease Class Enrichment**  
  Map drug targets to EFO disease classes and visualize FUSIL-based distributions

---

## Visualizations

- Bar plots of unique drugs per dataset  
- Log-log degree distributions of bipartite drugâ€“gene networks  
- Density plots of drugs per gene  
- Indication-weighted drug impact by FUSIL bin  
- Faceted bar charts of disease class enrichment per FUSIL category  

> All plots are generated using `ggplot2`.
